But some people think that this score overestimates the ability of typical high school seniors because only those who plan to attend college take the SAT. To check if this is true, a test was given to a SRS of 500 seniors from California. These students had an average score of xbar = 504. Is this enough evidence to say that the mean for all California seniors is lower than 519? Use a level of significance equal to α = 0.05. (Assume that σ = 100)."
