        "**Background:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In statistics, a probability distribution describes how the values of a random variable are distributed. Probability distributions can be classified into two main types: discrete and continuous. In this lab practice, we will focus on continuous probability distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "A continuous probability distribution is characterized by a continuous random variable, which can take any value within a certain range. Examples of continuous probability distributions include the normal distribution, exponential distribution, and uniform distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Normal Distribution:**\n",
        "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most widely encountered probability distributions in statistics. It is characterized by a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric around the mean. The mean, median, and mode of a normal distribution are equal, and the distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).\n",

        "BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that are used by the calculator.\n",
